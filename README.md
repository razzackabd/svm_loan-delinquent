📌 Project Title

Loan Delinquency Prediction Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

📖 Project Description

This project aims to predict loan delinquency using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm.
SVM is effective in handling high-dimensional data and works well for binary classification problems such as identifying delinquent and non-delinquent loan applicants.

The model learns an optimal decision boundary (hyperplane) that separates borrowers based on financial, credit, and demographic features.
